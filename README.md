It contains an email list screen as the home screen. On clicking on any email, the full description opens on another page. A button on the home screen allows the user to create and send a new email. After sending the email, the home screen opens automatically and the new list now contains sent email at the top. The home screen also has a search bar to search for any email in the list. On searching, only relevant emails should show up on the screen.
The user can also delete any email. (Home screen should update the list instantly after deleting)
